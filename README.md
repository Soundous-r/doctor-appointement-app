    A full-stack doctor appointment booking system built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) with Redux for state management. Features include patient registration, doctor approvals, appointment scheduling, and admin control.

This is a full-stack Doctor Appointment Booking Application developed using the MERN stack — MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js — with Redux for efficient state management.

The application allows patients to register, log in, browse available doctors, and book appointments. Doctors can register, complete their profiles, and wait for admin approval before they can start receiving appointments. The admin dashboard provides functionalities to approve or reject doctor applications and monitor user activity.

Key features include authentication with JWT, role-based access control (Admin, Doctor, User), real-time status updates for appointments.

This project is designed to simulate a real-world healthcare appointment system .
